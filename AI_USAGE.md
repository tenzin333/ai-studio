# AI Tool Usage Documentation

This document tracks where and how AI assistance was used in this project.

## Overview
AI tools (Claude, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) were used to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and understanding.

## Areas Where AI Was Used

### 🎨 Frontend Components (70% AI-assisted)
- **Dark Mode Implementation**: AI helped set up ThemeContext and global dark mode
- **Accessibility Features**: AI suggested ARIA labels and keyboard navigation patterns
- **Component Styling**: Tailwind classes and responsive design suggestions
- **File**: `src/components/Login.tsx`, `src/components/Upload.tsx`

### 🔧 Backend Implementation (50% AI-assisted)
- **JWT Authentication**: Basic structure suggested by AI, customized for requirements
- **Error Handling**: AI helped create consistent error response format
- **File**: `src/routes/auth.ts`, `src/middleware/auth.ts`

### 🧪 Testing Setup (80% AI-assisted)
- **Jest Configuration**: AI provided initial setup
- **Test Structure**: AI suggested testing patterns and mock strategies
- **E2E Tests**: AI helped with Playwright setup and test scenarios
- **File**: All test files, `jest.config.js`, `playwright.config.ts`

### 📋 Configuration Files (90% AI-assisted)
- **ESLint/Prettier**: AI provided recommended configurations
- **TypeScript Config**: AI suggested strict mode settings
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: AI helped structure GitHub Actions workflow
- **File**: `.eslintrc.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### 📝 Documentation (60% AI-assisted)
- **README**: Structure and setup instructions reviewed by AI
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI spec format suggestions
- **Code Comments**: AI helped improve JSDoc comments

## What Was NOT AI-Generated

### ✍️ Manual Implementation (100% human)
- **Business Logic**: Core generation logic and retry mechanism
- **Database Schema**: Designed based on requirements
- **State Management**: Custom hooks architecture
- **File Upload Logic**: Implemented from scratch
- **API Integration**: Custom fetch hooks and error handling

### 🔐 Security Considerations
- Password hashing implementation
- JWT token validation logic
- Input sanitization logic
- CORS configuration

## Development Process

1. **Initial Setup**: AI suggested project structure
2. **Feature Development**: Mix of AI suggestions and manual coding
3. **Testing**: AI helped with test setup, manual test cases written
4. **Refinement**: Manual debugging and optimization
5. **Documentation**: AI assisted with formatting, manual content

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
- Modern React patterns (lazy loading, context API)
- TypeScript strict mode benefits
- Comprehensive testing strategies
- CI/CD best practices
- Accessibility standards

## AI Tool Versions
- Claude: 3.5 Sonnet
- GitHub Copilot: Latest
- ChatGPT: GPT-4

## Verification
All AI-generated code was:
- ✅ Reviewed for security issues
- ✅ Tested thoroughly
- ✅ Understood before integration
- ✅ Customized for project needs
- ✅ Documented appropriately
